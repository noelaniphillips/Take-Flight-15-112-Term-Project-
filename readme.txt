Welcome to Take Flight! In Take Flight, the player controls a customizable bird 
who must use hills to gain speed and momentum to fly forward. Pressing the bottom key will cause the bird to drop when its in the air, and the 
better the playerâ€™s timing, the faster the bird will fly as it slides down and 
up hills. There will be two game modes: a training mode with randomly 
generated infinite terrain so the player can practice, and a race mode with a 
set terrain and a competing bird. Each of those modes will also have a day 
and night mode, which will change the background game. To run the game, the user
 should download cmu's 112 graphics module, which requires extra packages to install.
The user should run the trainingMode file and the birdClass file for the game 
to run properly, no extra modules needed! Libraries needed include math and copy. There are no shortcut commands.
